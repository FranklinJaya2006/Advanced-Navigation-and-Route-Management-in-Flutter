## Approach

to do this assignment, i read the requirements and Additional notes. From requirements and notes, i know something that we need for finish this assignment. First, we need to add provider, animations, and get, then i have to search the package from safari for the update version from the package. Second, i had to make error handling for handling if something happen. Third, to finish "For example, allow users to input a number, and then generate that number of new screens with unique content" i can use text field for the user input and for the generated screen i use widget to do it.

## Chalengges 

For this assignment, i get a chalengge how to use provider, and get dependency. Because i haven't heard the flutter package before, so i used provider for global state to count the screen and i used get package for set route for my apps, my another challengges is i don't know how to make the error handling. For the error handling i used get package to handle the error if something happen to my apps.
